## Security Considerations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict admin-only actions.
- **Data Privacy**: Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) and comply with GDPR/CCPA.
- **Payment Security**: Use Stripe for secure payment processing.
- **Music Copyright**: Implement copyright detection (e.g., via Content ID integration) to prevent unauthorized uploads.
- **Content Moderation**: Review music and artist media uploads for compliance with platform policies.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse with rate limiting on endpoints.
- **HTTPS**: Enforce secure communication with SSL/TLS.

## Future Enhancements
- **Mobile App**: Develop iOS and Android apps for better accessibility.
- **Video Chat**: Integrate WebRTC for virtual auditions or consultations.
- **AI Recommendations**: Use machine learning to suggest musicians, artists, or music based on client preferences.
- **Multi-language Support**: Add localization for global expansion.
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync musician/artist availability with Google Calendar or similar tools.
- **Royalty Management**: Enhance royalty tracking with detailed breakdowns and automated payouts.
