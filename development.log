Project setup: Created `frontend` and `backend` directories to structure the application code.

---

Backend setup: Initialized a Node.js project with Express and created a basic API endpoint to serve a static list of musicians.

User Role Refinement: Updated the backend talent data structure to include `user_type` (individual_artist, band) and added a sample band. Frontend filtering and display logic were updated to support `user_type` and show band members.

---

Git Push Attempt: Attempted to push the project to the remote repository `https://github.com/smile-plzz/MusicianForHire`, but it failed due to authentication issues. User needs to configure Git credentials locally.

---

Git Push Success: Successfully pushed the project to `https://github.com/smile-plzz/MusicianForHire` using SSH authentication.

---

Availability Enhancement: Updated the backend talent data structure to include more specific availability dates and added a `PUT /api/talent/:id/availability` endpoint to update talent availability.

Booking Flow for Bands Frontend: Modified the `TalentDetail` component to include input fields for `clientId` and `clientName` in the booking form.
