Development log for Musician for Hire SaaS platform.

Decision: Postponing implementation of user login/signup, verification, authentication, and payment processes to focus on core application features first.

---

Project setup: Created `frontend` and `backend` directories to structure the application code.

---

Backend setup: Initialized a Node.js project with Express and created a basic API endpoint to serve a static list of musicians.

Frontend setup: Created a React application and implemented a component to fetch and display musician data from the backend API.

---

Frontend Booking Form: Added a booking form to the `TalentDetail` component, allowing users to submit booking requests to the backend.

---

Booking Status Update: Implemented a backend endpoint (`PUT /api/bookings/:id`) to update the status of a booking. Added in-memory storage for bookings.

---

Booking Management UI: Implemented a frontend component (`BookingManagement.js`) to display and manage bookings, including accepting and declining requests. Added routing and navigation for this component.

Review System: Implemented a backend endpoint (`POST /api/reviews`) to receive and store reviews in-memory.

---

Review System Frontend: Added a review submission form and display for existing reviews on the `TalentDetail` page.

---

Communication Feature Frontend: Added a message submission form and display for existing messages on the `TalentDetail` page.

---

Music Analytics: Implemented a backend endpoint (`GET /api/music/analytics`) to provide simulated music distribution analytics.

---

User Role Refinement: Updated the backend talent data structure to include `user_type` (individual_artist, band) and added a sample band. Frontend filtering and display logic were updated to support `user_type` and show band members.

---

Availability Enhancement: Updated the backend talent data structure to include more specific availability dates and added a `PUT /api/talent/:id/availability` endpoint to update talent availability.
